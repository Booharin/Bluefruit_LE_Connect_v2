# Adafruit Bluefruit LE Connect for OSX (DFU)

This native OS X application contains a port of Nordic's DFU library to update the firmware on Bluefruit LE modules over the air from any recent Mac or Macbook with Bluetooth Low Energy support.

In addition to OTA DFU updates, it contains basic UART and Device Information functionality as an example of how you can interact with your Bluefruit LE module using Swift 2.0.

This is unsupported code that is not intended to be used in release applications, and is the result of internal testing with native OS X development with Swift and Bluetooth Low Energy.  Use at your own risk.

# Requirements

- OS X 10.10 or higher
- A recent Mac or Macbook with Bluetooth 4.0 support
- XCode 7 or higher to build and test the application
