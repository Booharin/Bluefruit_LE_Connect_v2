# Adafruit Bluefruit LE Connect for OSX (Nordic DFU)

This native OS X application contains a port of Nordic's DFU library to update the firmware on Bluefruit LE modules over the air from any recent Macbook with Bluetooth Low Energy support.

It also contains simple UART and Device Information Service sub-apps as a simple example of how you can interact with your Bluefruit LE module using Swift 2.0.

This is unsupported example code that is not intended to be used as a starting point for release applications, and is simply the results of some internal testing with native OS X development with Swift and Bluetooth Low Energy.

# Requirements

- OS X 10.10 or higher
- A recent Mac or Macbook with Bluetooth 4.0 support
